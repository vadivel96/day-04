How to compare two JSON have the same properties without order?
var obj1 = { name: "Person 1", age:5 };
var obj2 = { age:5, name: "Person 1" };

ans: 
       Better to use Lodash isEqual, it will return true as along as the key-value pair exists.
       It doesnt not concern with order as json.stringify does.
